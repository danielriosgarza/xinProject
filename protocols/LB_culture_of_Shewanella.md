# **LB Culture of *Shewanella oneidensis* strain**

## **Step 1: Prepare all the materials that we are going to need**

\\

1) Pioreactor glass tubes (autoclavable) 6 x;

\\

3) Lids 6X (not autoclavable): autclave some pieces of alumunium to store them.

\\

4) Ethanol 70%; destilled water for rinsing;

\\

5) Temperature probes and stir bars (6x);

\\

6) LB medium about 100 mL if we don't have it, we need to make it and autoclave.

\\

## **Step 2: Rescussitate the bacterium**

\\

1) Take the bacterium from the -80;

\\

2) inside the sterile bench add 12 ml of medium to two pioreactor tubes;

\\

3) add 100 uL of the culture to one of the tubes;

\\

4) Start two pioreactors with 30C, 500 rpm, with od monitoring, growth rate calculation for 48 h;

\\

 ## **Step 3: Innoculate three reactors plus negative control**

 \\

 1) Make a caluculation of OD = 0.1 to know how much media we need and how much from the pre-culture;

\\

2) Innoculate 1 empty pioreactor flask with 12 mL of medium and 3 with bacteria+medium;

\\

4) Start four pioreactors with 30 C, 500 rpm, with od monitoring, growth rate calculation for 120 h.
