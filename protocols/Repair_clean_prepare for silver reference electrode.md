## "Repair, clean and prepare for Ag/AgCl reference electrode"


Cleaning the exterior (electrode housing and connector)
Use water to rinse the electrode housing, if there is any contamination, use diluted soap to gently scrub and then rinse thoroughly with deionized water; if there is any salt crystal at the interface, use warm water to dissolve it.



Cleaning the interior (Ag/AgCl electrode wire)
If the electrode response is sluggish or the drift is large, :
- Mechanical cleaning: Use fine sandpaper or sanding cloth (e.g. 600~1200 grit) to gently polish the surface of the silver wire to remove oxidized layer or contaminants.
- Chemical cleaning: Soak the silver wire in dilute nitric acid (about 1 mol/L) for a few minutes to remove surface impurities; rinse it off with plenty of deionized water.



Re-chlorination (if the silver chloride layer is flaking or worn)
Electrochemical chlorination: in dilute HCl (0.1 M), with the silver wire as the anode and the platinum wire as the cathode, pass a current of 1 mA for about 1~3 minutes; the surface of the silver wire will generate a grayish-white layer of AgCl; rinse well with deionized water, air-dry or dry with filter paper and set aside.



Prepare electrode internal solution (1 M NaCl, because it is more suitable for microbial culture)
Weigh 5.84 g NaCl, add to a beaker, add water to about 90 mL, stir to dissolve and then volume to 100 mL (can be filtered and sterilized by 0.22 Î¼m filter membrane before use).
