# **Weekly Planning**

General goals:

- Familiarize yourself with the system, step-by-step:
0) Prepare you raspberry pi
1) Assemble a reactor
2) Control and program: temperature, pH, Optical density, current density one-by-one in water, in one reactor, in multiple reactors
3) Cultivate a bacteria isolate in the system: goal is to produce some electrical current in the working electrode
4) Control: pumps and do cultivation with control programs

**Mon**

- Printed model
- Meeting with Chrystelle to see the lab
- Assemble a reactor

- Read about the pioreactor (the base we are using for the mCPU): [here](https://docs.pioreactor.com/user-guide/getting-started)

- Challenge 1: control the temperature: make a squeme of 3h with 25C, 3h with 30, 3h with 35.



**Tue**
On reactor 6

Part 1: set the temperature
  pioreactor - manage - setting - temperature(add label)

part 2: program a small script to change the temperature at specific time

One by one control the reactor parameters with water

**Wed**

One by one control the reactor parameters with water

**Thu**

One by one control the reactor parameters with water

**Fri**

Prepare the media for the inoculation
